 CleanCity - Comprehensive QA Test Report
 Executive Summary
 This Quality Assurance (QA) report provides a comprehensive analysis of the CleanCity web
 application, a waste management system designed to help users schedule pickups, engage in
 community content, and raise environmental awareness. Testing was guided by the documented
 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-097). The evaluation included functional, usability, security,
 accessibility, and compatibility testing. This report outlines test strategies, findings, risks, and
 recommendations for improvement.
 Test Strategy & Approach
 The testing approach involved manual black-box testing using the CleanCity functional
 requirements document. Testing included: - Functional Testing - Usability & UX testing 
Compatibility Testing - Accessibility checks - Data validation and security assessment Browsers:
 Chrome, Firefox (latest versions) Devices: Desktop 1920x1080, Mobile View Storage: Browser
 localStorage

 Description
 BUG-001 Eldoret filter shows Nairobi data Filtering by Eldoret incorrectly shows Nairobi requests.
 BUG-002 Password stored in plain text
 Passwords saved in localStorage without encryption.
 BUG-003 Feedback form lacks validation
 Allows submission with empty comment field.
 Risk Assessment & Recommendations
 Critical issues such as incorrect data filtering and lack of validation could lead to user frustration,
 data integrity problems, or security vulnerabilities. The app currently stores passwords in plain text
 using localStorage, which is a significant security risk. Recommendations: - 
 Encrypt sensitive
 data (e.g., hashed passwords) - 
 Implement strong form validation across all modules - 
Improve dashboard filters and ensure consistent UI updates -  Ensure mobile responsiveness and
 accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance) -  Add backend support for scalable, secure storage and
 analytics

Conclusion
 The CleanCity app provides a solid foundation for a waste management platform. However, several
 critical areas require refinement before it can be considered production-ready. Most notably, the
 current use of localStorage without encryption, lack of form validation, and inconsistent UI filtering
 need urgent attention. With structured improvements guided by QA feedback, the system can
 become highly reliable, user-friendly, and secure.
